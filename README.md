### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 


I'm a Web Debeloper with HTML, CSS, JavaScript skills. 


How I work is a long story ðŸ¤” , but in a simple way: High-quality and operational layout of websites based on layouts. I work in compliance with deadlines and fulfillment of the TS. Pure cross-browser valid code. BEM, Adaptability, Pixel perfect, Flexbox, HTML5, CSS3, JS, Jquery, SASS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Page speed, Lighthouse...Whew! Something like that ðŸ˜„


ðŸŒ± Working with me is comfortable and I am always in touch (Telegram, Whatsapp, Email, phone) ðŸŒ±
